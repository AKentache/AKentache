- 👋 Hi, I’m Abdelatif Kentache (@AKentache).
- 👀 I’m interested in web and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, but more specifically am working through freeCodeCamp's materials.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment - not sure what I am even able to! 
- 📫 How to reach me: Currently, I am unavailable, but will update this once circumstances permit.
